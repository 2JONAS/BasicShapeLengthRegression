# Classification of basic shape based on pointNet
We design a experiment based on PointNet to measure/fit the basic shape object size.

The experimental process is as follows:

1. Generate synthetic 3d point data with size classification label
2. Train classification network based on pointNet
3. Extract the feature map of pointnet
4. Design the tail of network to fit the size label

## TODO
Add the size regression for baisc shape
